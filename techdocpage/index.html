            <h2>How It Works</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Arduino based HVAC utilizes common household heating and cooling parts to create an easily accessible
            and affordable heating and cooling system for a hobby greenhouse.
        </p>
        <p>For cooling air intake a digitally controlled
            evaporative cooler was stripped of its controls, and is managed by the arduino. The evaporative cooler
            utilizes
            a 120VAC three speed fan and recirculating water pump, both of which are now conrolled by the arduino. The
            arduino
            controls HI, MED, LOW, and OFF on the fan, and turns the recirculating water pump on and off based on the
            temperature set points.
            The four module relay board that conrols the AC voltage is remoteley placed on the evaporative cooler and
            not inside the arduino
            enclosure, minimizing exposure to mains voltage. Cooling exhaust is currently using a standard box fan also
            controlled by cooling
            set points. Linear acutators can also be implemented to open and shut the roof vents rather than using an
            exhaust fan.

        </p>
        <p>For heating the greenhouse uses an inexpensive manually controlled instant hot water heater and large
            reservoir (currently a food
            insulating cooler) to supply hot water to the growing benches. The Arduino controls a small DC water pump
            that pushes coolant through
            the hot water heater and keep the heat reservoir at a specified temperature. Individual water pumps are used
            to pump coolant from the reservoir
            and divert coolant through
            separate heating zones, including growing benches and a hydroponic nutrient reservoir to maintain
            individually specified set points. Each
            heat zone is measured by a DS18B20 waterproof digital temperature sensor. Plumbing is PEX tubing, and grow
            benches ran with internal PEX
            tubing and benches filled with sand. Plastic sheeting is placed on top of the growing bench, and plants are
            placed on top of the plastic sheeting.
            No plant roots are directly exposed to heat tubing to minimize any root damage via heat.
        </p>
        <p>Currently no datalogging capabilities or remote communication has been implemented. The current configuration
            occupies almost all I/O ports on the
            UNO. Datalogging and remote communication are currently implemented with an external computer connected via
            USB. There is no immediate concern to
            incorporate these into the UNO, an external computer still has an advantage over the UNO with versatility,
            communication options and heavy data processing
            capabilities.

        <h3>Arduino Output Connections</h3>
        <span>All outputs are connected on the DIGITAL (PWM~) I/O side:
            <ol start="0">
                <li>no connection</li>
                <li>no connection</li>
                <li>Heat Zone 1 relay</li>
                <li>Heat Zone 2 relay</li>
                <li>Heat Zone 3 relay</li>
                <li>Heat Zone 4 relay</li>
                <li>Heat Zone 5 relay</li>
                <li>Exhaust vent actuator (open) relay</li>
                <li>Exhaust vent actuator (close) relay</li>
                <li>Evaporative cooling water pump relay</li>
                <li>High speed cooling fan relay</li>
                <li>Medium speed cooling fan relay</li>
                <li>Low speed cooling fan relay</li>
                <li>no connection</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Arduino Input Connection</h3>
            <span>All input connections are made on the ANALOG IN input side:</span>
            <ol start="0">
                <li>Electrical enclosure temperature DHT sensor</li>
                <li>Greenhouse temperature DHT sensor</li>
                <li>Outdoor ambient temperature DHT sensor</li>
                <li>All heat zone DS18B20 sensors</li>
                <li>Evaporative cooler low water sensor</li>
                <li>no connection</li>
            </ol>

            Note: With the exception of the DHT sensors, the inputs are not requried to be on the ANALOG IN side of the
            board, but this made for a logical
            arrangement of the sensor I/O. Any change of these connection locations would involve updating the code to
            reflect the changes.
