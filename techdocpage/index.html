                <h2>How It Works</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The Arduino based HVAC utilizes common household heating and cooling parts to create an easily accessible
                and affordable heating and cooling system for a hobby greenhouse.
            </p>
            <p>For cooling air intake a digitally controlled
                evaporative cooler was stripped of its controls, and is managed by the arduino. The evaporative cooler
                utilizes a 120VAC three speed fan and recirculating water pump, both of which are now conrolled by the
                arduino.
                The arduino controls HI, MED, LOW, and OFF on the fan, and turns the recirculating water pump on and off
                based on
                the temperature set points.
                The four module relay board that conrols the AC voltage is remoteley placed on the evaporative cooler
                and not inside the arduino enclosure, minimizing exposure to mains voltage. Cooling exhaust is currently
                using a standard box fan
                also controlled by cooling
                set points. Linear acutators can also be implemented to open and shut the roof vents rather than using
                an
                exhaust fan.
            </p>
            <p>For heating the greenhouse uses an inexpensive manually controlled instant hot water heater and large
                reservoir (currently a food
                insulating cooler) to supply hot water to the growing benches. The Arduino controls a small DC water
                pump
                that pushes coolant through
                the hot water heater and keep the heat reservoir at a specified temperature. Individual water pumps are
                used
                to pump coolant from the reservoir
                and divert coolant through
                separate heating zones, including growing benches and a hydroponic nutrient reservoir to maintain
                individually specified set points. Each
                heat zone is measured by a DS18B20 waterproof digital temperature sensor. Plumbing is PEX tubing, and
                grow
                benches ran with internal PEX
                tubing and benches filled with sand. Plastic sheeting is placed on top of the growing bench, and plants
                are
                placed on top of the plastic sheeting.
                No plant roots are directly exposed to heat tubing to minimize any root damage via heat.
            </p>
            <p>Currently no datalogging capabilities or remote communication has been implemented. The current
                configuration
                occupies almost all I/O ports on the
                UNO. Datalogging and remote communication are currently implemented with an external computer connected
                via
                USB. There is no immediate concern to
                incorporate these into the UNO, an external computer still has an advantage over the UNO with
                versatility,
                communication options and heavy data processing
                capabilities.

            <h3>Arduino Output Connections</h3>
            <span>All outputs are connected on the DIGITAL (PWM~) I/O side:
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>no connection</li>

                    <li>no connection</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Arduino Input Connection</h3>
                <span>All input connections are made on the ANALOG IN input side:</span>
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>Electrical enclosure temperature DHT sensor</li>
                    <li>Greenhouse temperature DHT sensor</li>
                    <li>Outdoor ambient temperature DHT sensor</li>
                    <li>All heat zone DS18B20 sensors</li>
                    <li>Evaporative cooler low water sensor</li>
                    <li>no connection</li>
                </ol>

                <p> Note: With the exception of the DHT sensors, the inputs are not requried to be on the ANALOG IN side
                    of
                    the board, but this made for a logical
                    arrangement of the sensor I/O. Any change of these connection locations would involve updating the
                    code
                    to reflect the changes.

            </header>
            <p> Before the DS18B20 sensors can relay data, the device addresses have to be changed in the code.
                If the device address is not marked on the sensor, there are many simple sketches already written for
                the
                UNO
                that
                will display a connected device's address, <a
                    href="https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library">here is one on GitHub.</a>
                On line 56, replace the device address listed with the device addresses of the temperature sensors
                to be used, following the same format:
            </p>

            <code>
        DeviceAddress t5 = { 0x28, 0xAA, 0x3C, 0xF9, 0x37, 0x14, 0x01, 0xE7 }; // Zone 5<br>
        DeviceAddress t4 = { 0x28, 0xAA, 0xE8, 0xBD, 0x37, 0x14, 0x01, 0x48 }; // Zone 4<br>
        DeviceAddress t3 = { 0x28, 0xA9, 0xAC, 0x0F, 0x30, 0x14, 0x01, 0x0B }; // Zone 3<br>
        DeviceAddress t2 = { 0x28, 0xAA, 0x57, 0xAF, 0x1A, 0x13, 0x02, 0x5F }; // Zone 2<br>
        DeviceAddress t1 = { 0x28, 0xAA, 0xC4, 0x13, 0x1B, 0x13, 0x02, 0x8E }; // Zone 1<br>
        </code><br>
            Setting up the temperature set points in the program involves changing the specific element of the
            <code>setPointArray</code>, starting on line 181:
            <code>
        // Set heating and cooling temperatures in degrees F<br>
        setPointArray[0] = 70; // Cooling Stage -1<br>
        setPointArray[1] = 75; // Cooling Stage 0<br>
        setPointArray[2] = 80; // Cooling Stage 1<br>
        setPointArray[3] = 85; // Cooling Stage 2<br>
        setPointArray[4] = 90; // Cooling Stage 3<br>
        setPointArray[5] = 110; // Min Res Temp<br>
        setPointArray[6] = 115; // Max Res Temp<br>
        setPointArray[7] = 72; // Bench 1 Temp<br>
        setPointArray[8] = 72; // Bench 2 Temp<br>
        setPointArray[9] = 72; // Hydro Res 1 (NFT Channel) Temp<br>
        setPointArray[10] = 72; // Hydro Res 2 (Bench 1 Res) Temp<br><br>
        </code>
            Explanation of these set points are as follows:
            <ol start="0">
                <li>Cooling Stage 1: 70 degrees f (Below this temperature the heat is engaged)</li>
                <li>Cooling Stage 0: 75 degrees f (Above this temperature heating is turned off, below this temperature
                    cooling is turned off)</li>
                <li>Cooling Stage 1: 80 degrees f (above this temperature low speed cooling is engaged)</li>
                <li>Cooling Stage 2: 85 degrees f (above this temperature med speed cooling is engaged)</li>
                <li>Cooling Stage 3: 90 degrees f (above this temperature high speed cooling is engaged)</li>
                <li>Zone 1 min temp: 110 degrees f (reservoir heating turns on at this temperature)</li>
                <li>Zone 1 max temp: 115 degrees f (reservoir heating turns off at this temperature)</li>
                <li>Zone 2 set temp: 72 degrees f (heating is turned off when zone reaches this temperature)</li>
                <li>Zone 3 set temp: 72 degrees f (heating is turned off when zone reaches this temperature)</li>
                <li>Zone 4 set temp: 72 degrees f (heating is turned off when zone reaches this temperature)</li>
                <li>Zone 5 set temp: 72 degrees f (heating is turned off when zone reaches this temperature)</li>
            </ol>
            To change the setpoint of each element in the array replace the integer in the code (starting on line
            97):<br>
            <code>
        // Set heating and cooling temperatures in degrees F<br>
        setPointArray[0] = 70; // Cooling Stage -1<br>
        </code><br>

            There is a water heater shut off bypass implemented into the heating circuit. Typically the manually
            controlled
            instant how water heater
            have a safety shut off if the unit runs for more than 10 minutes. A one minute cool down of the heater every
            120
            program cycles during heating
            avoids an unwanted heater shutoff: <br>
            <code>
        // Water heater shutoff bypass, turn OFF reservoir heater pump for 10 seconds every 10 minutes<br>
        void heaterCount() {<br>
            &nbsp;if (count >= 120) { // program has about 5 seconds of delay in it, turn OFF pump every 120 program cycles<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // Turn OFF reservoir pump<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;delay(60000); // Wait 60 seconds<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;count = 0; // Reset counter<br>
                &nbsp;}<br>
                &nbsp;count++;<br>
        }<br>
